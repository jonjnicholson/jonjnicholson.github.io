				"content_html": "<h2 id=\"what-is-it\">What is it?</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://tailscale.com/kb/1151/what-is-tailscale/#the-benefits\">Tailscale</a> is a VPN service that makes the devices and applications you own accessible anywhere in the world, securely and effortlessly. It enables encrypted point-to-point connections using the open source WireGuard protocol, which means only devices on your private network can communicate with each other.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It has a very generous free tier that includes most of the features included in the higher paid tiers while limiting you to 100 devices&ndash;more than enough for my use cases.</p>\n<h2 id=\"where-does-it-work\">Where does it work?</h2>\n<p>Tailscale also has apps and integrations with all the operating systems and devices that I require. I have it installed on my <a href=\"https://pi-hole.net/\">pi-hole</a> and <a href=\"https://www.home-assistant.io/\">home assistant</a> Raspberry Pi&rsquo;s as well as my iPhone, Mac, and <a href=\"https://www.synology.com/en-us\">Synology NAS</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ad-blocking\">Ad blocking</h2>\n<p>I have been casually using Tailscale, but I recently read this <a href=\"https://tailscale.com/kb/1114/pi-hole/\">post</a> that explained how to use Tailscale in coordination with your Pi-Hole to get ad-blocking even when I&rsquo;m not at home.</p>\n<p>One issue I ran into was covered by the <a href=\"https://tailscale.com/kb/1114/pi-hole/#troubleshooting\">troubleshooting</a> section of the previously mentioned article, but the UI of my Pi-Hole running versions <code> Pi-hole v5.17.1 FTL v5.23 Web Interface v5.20.1</code> did look a little different.</p>\n<h2 id=\"using-tailscale-while-traveling\">Using Tailscale while traveling</h2>\n<p>Another aspect of Tailscale I recently learned is the concept of <a href=\"https://tailscale.com/kb/1103/exit-nodes/\">exit nodes</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The exit node feature lets you route all non-Tailscale internet traffic through a specific device on your network.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This means that I can use Tailscale in place of other VPN options to secure my internet traffic when I&rsquo;m traveling and using public wifi.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>I&rsquo;m very happy with how powerful Tailscale is as well as how great the documentation is. The free tier is extremely useful and I&rsquo;m surprised that they offer all they do in the tier.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I wanted to start off by sharing how I set up this my original homepage. I was impressed by how easy it was to do, especially since I&rsquo;m new to both Hugo and Cloudflare Pages.</p>\n<p>I followed the <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-hugo-site/\">excellent documentation</a> that Cloudflare provides. If you&rsquo;re not married to the idea of using Hugo, they also provide great documentation on <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/\">other frameworks</a>.</p>\n<p>One thing I missed the first time I pushed updates to my repo was <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-hugo-site/#using-a-specific-hugo-version\">setting the version of Hugo</a>. The version that Hugo provides is older and didn&rsquo;t work with my chosen theme.</p>\n",
